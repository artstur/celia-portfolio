        <p>Within urban landscapes, it is the public space, more specifically, what constitutes the fundamental domain in the provision and protection of democracy, for it is in the public space where the most profound manifestations of social conflict, individual self-expression, and cultural exchange take place.</p>
        <p>Through the site, I hope to look into public space as representation of our shared conditions of existence, as expression of difference, values, individuality, universality, knowledge, and power, and study how the changes I introduce in the received configuration of the public imply, inevitably, the affirmation, the manipulation, and the suppression of some of those conditions.</p>

        <h3>04. Ideation</h3>
        <p>In the ideation, I worked on connecting the waterfront to the greater urban system with the idea of bringing the city close to the water and vice-versa. The result is a strong connection with the surroundings through a planting strategy that brings urban axes into the site connected to framed wooded areas.</p>
        <p>These trees planted areas are connected to different waterscapes: pools, water squares or river edges. My goal is to design a succession of public spaces that using the ecology of a wooded area and the hydrology of the river would define a variety of open spaces, able to allow different communities to experience in multiple ways the waterfront as an urban system of recreation and leisure.</p>
