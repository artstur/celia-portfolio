        <p>After discussing with the team to understand our objectives and what would create an attractive user
          experience, we decided to create an easy to use mobile game for both web3 and non-web3 users.</p>
        <p>I also defined various placement points for the game throughout the app and mapped out the flow:</p>

          <h4>II. Reflections</h4>
          <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using the image recognition algorithm to recognize the type of food after pictures are taken.</li>
            <li>Connecting the Unity app with Solana protocol to update smart contracts was very difficult.</li>
            <li>Making a critical choice on which Blockchain to use. We went for Solana because it was easy to integrate
              with Unity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4"><b>Accomplishments:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The team worked hard and made sure that the mobile app could recognize the picture of the food.</li>
            <li>We made sure to design an easy to use mobile UX for non-web3 users.</li>
            <li>We were able to build a complete MVP for the app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4"><b>What I learned:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's important to have a team with diverse experience that can contribute different perspectives to the
              projects.</li>
            <li>We had to develop new skills on how to integrate Solana with the Unity app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4"><b>What's next for Buffet:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We plan to improve the algorithm to identify different food.</li>
            <li>We would like to launch a beta version of the application.</li>
            <li>We would build out the NFT marketplace for the app.</li>
