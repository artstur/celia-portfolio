        <h3>Problem Space</h3>
        <p>As growing retail investors flood the market, investors need better analytics more than ever. However, more
          than half of retail investors are NOT satisfied with the existing insights and research provided by
          brokerages.

        <h3>01. Research</h3>
        <h4>I. Background Research</h4>
        <p>To better understand the addressed problem and have a macro view of the market, I did a background research
          first based on these questions brought by stakeholders: Why are we doing this for the market? Why are we the
          best to do this? How much impact would we have? How many potential target users would we get?

            <p>Takeaways:</p>
            <li>The typical target user is 24-45 year old investors who are more likely to trust technology + advisors,
              which accounts for about 25% of US stock market trading volume.</li>
            <li>I suggest to highlight our high tech strengths like AI, date mining, investment module, gragh, HCI,
              blockchain and data process, which plays an impoartant role in attracting them and let them trust in our
              platform.</li>
            <li>Accrording to the research, services we provide could include personal investment strategy, reliable
              platform with certificated analysts,infomation processing, and solid research and stoke market news.</li>

        <h4>II. Competitive & Industry Landscape</h4>
        <p>I assessed how the client stacks up against competitors and usability leaders, and identified opportunities
          for innovation in problem solving, market segments, and unique value proposition.</p>

        <h3>02. User Research</h3>
        <h4>I. User Survey</h4>
        <p>To start, I conducted user research with the UX team through participatory, qualitative, and quantitative
          methods to enable understanding of the context as well as the usersâ€™ needs. We co-created the user survey and
          sent it widely to collect useful data, from which we learned about basic information, investment habits, needs
          and pain points of our target users.

        <h4>II. User Interview</h4>
        <p>We conducted interviews with our selected target users from among the survey respondents who were willing to
          be interviewed. They are invited to test the exisiting Armadillo platform. A range of people were engaged,
          including roles such as Investment company CEO, PhD student in science and engineering, senior product
          manager, individual investor. Stakeholders from Armadillo were also involved in the process to provide a
          technical perspective.</p>
